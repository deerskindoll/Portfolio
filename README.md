# Portfolio
This portfolio includes samples of my tech writing ranging from use cases to tech documentation

**CS Squash Tournament** and **CS RPi** are samples of my work as a copywriter for [CamStreamer](https://camstreamer.com/). Since it's a IT startup, the use cases I was tasked to write were often quite technical. 
- **Squash Tournament** is a user friendly description of a live stream setup for a squash tournament. 
- **CS RPi** is a manual on how to install a widget developed by CamStreamer on a Raspberry Pi.

**Sim_Entrance token** and **Sim_Access data** are excerpts of technical documents for a fictional app, created to showcase my tech writing skills.
